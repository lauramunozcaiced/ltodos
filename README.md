## Key Features

- Machine learning unsupervised clustering
  - Thanks to k-means algorithm we can cluster the colors and select the most representatives
  - This could have been done with an histogram, but where is the fun on that?
- Pyscript proxy with javascript events
  - Pyscript allows the communication between js and python by proxies and specific attributes.
